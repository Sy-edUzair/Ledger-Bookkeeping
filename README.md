📒 Ledger-Bookkeeping

Ledger-Bookkeeping is a simple Python application that implements a double-entry bookkeeping system, enforcing correct accounting rules to help track financial transactions reliably.

This project aims to provide a lightweight and intuitive solution for personal or small-business bookkeeping based on the core accounting principle that every debit must have a corresponding credit (double-entry accounting).

🧾 Features

✔ Enforces double-entry accounting principles

✔ Organizes financial records into balanced ledger entries

✔ Simple and extendable Python-based bookkeeping structure

✔ Easily customizable for different accounting workflows

Double-entry bookkeeping is an accounting method where every transaction impacts at least two accounts, ensuring that the accounting equation
Assets = Liabilities + Equity always remains balanced.

🚀 Getting Started

Install the required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

Start using the bookkeeping system

Explore the code in the bookkeeping/ directory and build ledger entries based on your use case.

🧠 How It Works

This app enforces double-entry bookkeeping, meaning:

Each financial transaction is entered as both a debit and a credit

Debits and credits are balanced so that total debits = total credits

The system helps ensure financial integrity and accurate books

This makes it suitable for basic accounting workflows, budgeting, and financial tracking.

🧩 Example Entry (Pseudo)

Below is a conceptual example of a transaction in double-entry bookkeeping:

Date: 2025-01-01

Debit  | Account            | Amount
-------------------------------------
       | Expenses:Office    | ₹500

Credit | Account            | Amount
-------------------------------------
       | Assets:Cash        | ₹500


This transaction records an office expense paid in cash.

🔗 About Double-Entry Accounting

Double-entry bookkeeping is the standard accounting method used to keep financial records accurate and consistent. Every transaction affects two or more accounts, and books are only considered balanced when total debits equal total credits.
